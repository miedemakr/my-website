I am currently a student at Grand Valley State University pursuing an M.S. in Data Science and Analytics. My goal is to graduate and move into industry with an emphasis on machine learning. I am also a Data Analytics Intern at Spectrum Health, focusing on data cleaning and improving processes. In my free time I enjoy reading, programming in R, and spending time with my dog Theo (who you may have noticed on the home page).\r\nFeel free to get in touch with me using any of the links below!\r\nContact\r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
